"""
Log levels adapted from the `Apache Commons` Logging User Guide:

http://commons.apache.org/logging/guide.html#Message%20Priorities/Levels

Each level includes all of the levels below it.

* ``Debug`` - Detailed information on the flow through the system.

* ``Warn`` - Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors,
  other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not
  necessarily "wrong".

* ``Info`` - Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect
  these to be immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and
  keep to a minimum.

* ``Error`` - Severe errors that cause premature termination. This
  would rarely be seen.


Examples:

some_thing = "something"
something = "something"
thing = "thing"

log_debug("Something is broken!!!")

log_debug("%s is broken!!!!", some_thing)

log_debug("In %s there is a broken %s", something, thing)

log_debug("In %s there is a broken %s", (something, thing))

log_debug("In %s there is a broken %s", [something, thing])
