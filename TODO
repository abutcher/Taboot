- Add task(s?) to do RPM manifests and generate diffs

- Add timestamps to logging

- Don't overwrite logs; append to them

- Add tasks to block on some event (keyboard input, etc.) so you can
  do things like prompt for user to hit enter after verifying
  something or performing some out-of-band task (like pushing puppet
  code in between two tasks)
