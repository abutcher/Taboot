# This is a maintainer script intended to facilitate making
# releases. Word to the wise, it won't work for most people. You need
# a fedorahosted account and your system needs to be configured with
# the user certificates to communicate with Koji build systems.
#
# What does this really do? It automates the process of building RPMs
# for three different target platforms: RHEL5, RHEL6, and Fedora
# 14. This includes the building of the source RPMs with any
# appropriate flags for compatability, as well as submitting the
# source RPMs to a Koji build server which builds the binary RPMs.
#
# As an added bonus this script runs the SRPM builds and Koji uploads
# in parallel via subprocesses.
#
# Final note: The final step requires an external program called
# download-scratch.py. This will be the case until Taboot is in the
# Repos and can make non-scratch builds in Koji. download-scratch.py
# is available at:
# http://people.redhat.com/mikeb/scripts/download-scratch.py and
# should be placed in your $PATH.
