Not the project maintainer? This file isn't all that relevant for you,
it's just so I have a procedure to follow so I can make consistent
releases. But feel free to read anyway.


) Switch to devel branch

) Hack

) Test as much as possible

) Run some test rpmbuilds

) Update documentation if necessary. Run spellcheck.

) Build documentation and check:
    - Any unexpected build-time messages
    - That it correctly renders

When satisfied:

) Update /VERSION and /taboot/__init__.py's __version__

) Kick off a koji build: /maintainer-scripts/make-release.rb

) Fix any build problems/check for correctness

When complete:

) Switch to master

) Merge in devel

) Tag it in git and push to fedorahosted:
    - tito tag
    - git push fedora --tags

) Kick off a koji build: /maintainer-scripts/make-release.rb

When complete:

) Switch to $RELEASEDIR (something like /tmp/builder.somethingrandom)

) Create the "latest" symlinks with the "taboot-latest-linker" script

) Mount people.redhat.com/~tbielawa/ on ~/nethome

) cp $RELEASEDIR/* ~/nethome/taboot/

) Unmount nethome

When complete:

) Update websites "Latest News" with release date, version, and changelog

) ???

) Profit
