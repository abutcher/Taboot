			       Taboot
			       ========
	 Client library for performing deployments with func
		  <https://fedorahosted.org/Taboot/>

What's it for?
==============

Taboot uses simple YAML files to help you script common task
patterns on groups of hosts.


I don't get it, show me an example.
===================================

Here's an example YAML file, it's pretty self-explanatory.

# Begin example
---
- hosts:
    - www*.example.com

  preflight:
    - nagios.ScheduleDowntime:
        nagios_url: nagios.int.example.com
        minutes: 5
        service: httpd

  tasks:
    - service.Stop: {service: httpd}

    - yum.Update
 
    - service.Start: {service: httpd}
# End example

Notice you can do shell-like globs when specifying the target hosts.

You would use this in this manner:

  $ taboot httpd-update.yaml


Building (Makefile Targets)
===========================

Useful makefile targets:

clean - Clean out obvious trash

docs - Compiles the HTML and manpage documentation

viewdoc - Compiles the HTML documentation and loads it in a browser
