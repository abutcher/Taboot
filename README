			       Taboot
			       ========
	 Client library for performing deployments with func


What's it for?
==============

Taboot uses simple YAML files to help you script common task
patterns on groups of hosts.


I don't get it, show me an example.
===================================

Here's an example YAML file, it's pretty self-explanatory.

# Begin example
- hosts:
    - java*.int.example.com

  tasks:
    - type: nagios.ScheduleDowntime
      kwargs:
        nagios_url: https://nagios.int.example.com/nagios/cgi-bin/cmd.cgi
        minutes: 15
        service: JBOSS

    - type: mod_jk.OutOfRotation
      args:
        - balancer01.int.example.com

    - type: command.Run
      args: service jbossas stop || true

    - type: puppet.Run

    - type: service.Start
      args: jbossas

    - type: mod_jk.InRotation
      args:
        - balancer01.int.example.com
# End example

Notice you can do shell-like globs when specifying the target hosts.

You would use this in this manner:

  $ taboot java-update.yaml
