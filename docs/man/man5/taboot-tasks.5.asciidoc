NAME
----
taboot-tasks - quick reference for the built in tasks




DESCRIPTION
-----------

Taboot is a tool for written for scripting and automating the task of
performing software releases in a large-scale infrastructure. Release
scripts are written using YAML syntax.

Taboot tasks are pre-written actions to perform on a given host. For
example, scheduling downtime in Nagios, or updating all the RPMs on a
system. The tasks documented here can be used in __preflight__ and
__tasks__ blocks. The syntax of each possible tasks varies. Taboot
comes with many built-in tasks.

This quick-reference is example based and only uses abbreviated forms
where possible.


Command
-------

The *Command* task lets you run arbitrary commands on the remote host.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Install httpd on all matching hosts
    - command.Run: {command: yum -y install httpd}


Service
-------

The *Service* task provides an interface to the system __service__
command.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Start httpd on all matching hosts
    - service.Start: {service: httpd}
    # Stop httpd on all matching hosts
    - service.Stop: {service: httpd}
    # Restart httpd on all matching hosts
    - service.Restart: {service: httpd}


Puppet
------

The *Puppet* task provides a uniform way to interact with the puppet
service. This includes enabling/disabling the daemon and manually
forcing a catalog run.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Enable puppet
    - puppet.Enable
    # Disable puppet
    - puppet.Disable
    # Delete that stubborn lockfile
    - puppet.DeleteLockfile
    # Test run
    - puppet.Run
    # Do a paranoid test run (quit Taboot on possible errors)
    - puppet.SafeRun


Nagios
------

The *Nagios* task lets you handle notifications and set downtime from
your Taboot scripts.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Disable alerts for all matching hosts
    - nagios.DisableAlerts:
        nagios_url: nagios.example.com
    # Enable alerts for all matching hosts
    - nagios.EnableAlerts:
        nagios_url: nagios.example.com
    # Schedule a 60 minute downtime for httpd, git and XMLRPC on
    # all matching hosts
    - nagios.ScheduleDowntime:
        nagios_url: nagios.example.com
        service: [httpd, git, XMLRPC]
        minutes: 60


Sleep
-----

The *Sleep* task is used to halt further task processing for a
specified period of time.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Pauses execution for 5 minutes
    - sleep.Seconds: {seconds: 300}
    # Also pauses execution for 5 minutes
    - sleep.Minutes: {minutes: 5}
    # Pauses execution until the user presses Enter
    - sleep.WaitOnInput
    # Also pauses execution until user presses Enter
    # but also allows you to override the message prompt
    - sleep.WaitOnInput: {message: "This is the user prompt:"}

Yum
---

The *Yum* task lets you install, remove, and update RPMs right in your
Taboot scripts.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Install three packages
    - yum.Install: {packages: [httpd, php5, screen]}
    # Remove the same three packages
    - yum.Remove: {packages: [httpd, php5, screen]}
    # Update the same three packages
    - yum.Update: {packages: [httpd, php5, screen]}


RPM
---

The *RPM* task provides two utility actions that, when used together,
report any RPMs that changed between the PreManifest and PostManifest.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [www0*.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Take a PreManifest of all installed packages
    - rpm.PreManifest
    # Use yum to update all the system RPMs.
    - yum.Update
    # Take a PostManifest and diff it against the PreManifest
    # The diff is printed after PostManifest finishes running.
    - rpm.PostManifest



AJP
---

The *AJP* task provides a uniform way to put nodes into and out of
rotation in a mod_jk AJP balancer. This module is a great replacement
for manually adding and removing nodes in a jkmanage management panel.

[literal]
---
- hosts: [tomcat*.int.company.com]
  tasks:
    # Take the matching node out of rotation
    - mod_jk.OutOfRotation:
        proxies:
            - proxyjava01.web.prod.int.example.com
            - proxyjava02.web.prod.int.example.com
    # Do stuff....
    # do more stuff...
    # Put the node back into the pool
    - mod_jk.InRotation:
        proxies:
            - proxyjava01.web.prod.int.example.com
            - proxyjava02.web.prod.int.example.com
