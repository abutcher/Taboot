Getting Started
===============

What you need
-------------

Put simply, Taboot lets you write a script of actions (:ref:`tasks`)
and execute it on multiple hosts, concurrently if you wish. The
actions come from a standard library, this ensures consistency. Taboot
ships with multiple forms of logging (:ref:`output`). A little Python
is all you need to know if you want to expand the library with your
own custom tasks.

To start using Taboot you need:

A Func Infrastructure
`````````````````````

A working `Func installation <http://fedorahosted.org/func>`_ is
required. Func is the system over which Taboot executes all of it's
commands. It's comparable to the cell phone network you would have a
conversation over.

Setting up Func is the hardest part and coincidentally is outside of
the scope of this document. See the Func website for instructions:

.. seealso::

   `Func setup instructions <https://fedorahosted.org/func/wiki/InstallAndSetupGuide>`_


A Repetitive Task
`````````````````

Taboot is ideal for scripting a task that needs to happen over and
over again. An example of this is a software release script, or a
maintenance script for rolling updates to a cluster.



A Working Knowledge of YAML
```````````````````````````

Taboot scripts are simple text files. They are written in format
called YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language). YAML is whitespace
sensitive, but otherwise fairly forgiving in what you try to do with
it.

You can get away with just applying the patterns shown here when
writing your own scripts. But understanding the language semantics
goes a long way when debugging the inevitable syntax error.

.. note::

    YAML is designed as a "human-readable data serialization format",
    not a markup language. Which is to say, the language concerns
    itself with data structures (lists, strings, dictionaries, keys),
    not document description. We will describe elements of the Taboot
    syntax in the same way.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`YAMLScripts`
       Complete documentation of the YAML syntax `taboot` understands.

   :ref:`tasks`
       Documentation for each of the built-in tasks `taboot` provides.


Writing Your First Script
-------------------------


Concepts Covered
````````````````

Lets get started and write a Taboot script. This example will build up
to a script that performs a rolling update of a web server cluster in
our fictitious domain: ``friendfrobber.com``. When complete it will
demonstrate:

* Using `globbing` to select hosts
* Operating on multiple hosts at once
* Advanced logging techniques
* Use of the preflight element
* Scheduling downtime in Nagios
* Updating packages via Yum
* Showing a summary of all changed RPMs


The FriendFrobber.com Infrastructure
````````````````````````````````````

    **MegaFrobber**: `Reach out and Frob some one!` â„¢

You are a sysadmin for `FriendFrobber.com`, makers of the widely
popular social networking service `MegaFrobber`. As such, you are
responsible for maintaining the application servers in their
high-availability web cluster. Part of that responsibility includes
releasing updates to the server component of `MegaFrobber`. These are
your hosts:

* ``www01.ext.friendfrobber.com``
* ``www02.ext.friendfrobber.com``
* ``www11.ext.friendfrobber.com``
* ``www12.ext.friendfrobber.com``

For the sake of simplicity we're going to assume that the wizards in
networking have taken care of all the load balancing to the webserver
pool. To further simplify things, unhealthy nodes are removed from
service automatically (thanks networking!).

Also living in the `FriendFrobber.com` domain is a monitoring server
with Nagios installed. This server watches the ``wwwXX`` hosts and
pages the sysadmin team if it notices any webserver isn't responsing
to requests.

* ``monitor.util.friendfrobber.com``

``monitor`` has the `Func` Nagios Server plugin installed so that
downtime can be handled remotely.

Finally there is your administration center:

* ``overlord.util.friendfrobber.com``

``overord`` is the command center on which you store and run your
Taboot scripts.

   * `Nagios <http://www.nagios.com>`_ - `The Industry Standard in IT Infrastructure Monitoring`


Script Elements
```````````````

Taboot scripts are broken up into multiple sections. Each section is
called an `element` (see: :ref:`elements`).

* ``hosts``
* ``concurrency``
* ``output``
* ``preflight``
* ``tasks``

.. note::

    The only required elements are ``hosts`` and ``tasks``. The rest
    are optional or have sane defaults.

The data of the ``hosts`` element is a list. Each item in the list is
a hostname, or a glob that can be expanded into a hostname. When
Taboot executes your script it will iterate over each host represented
in this list.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
   Prior to this version the order that hosts appeared in this list
   was not guaranteed to be representative of the actual order of
   execution.

   From version 0.4.0 onward Taboot implements **strict ordering** and
   (except for expanded globs) guarantees that the order of execution
   will match the order of definition.

The ``concurrency`` element specifies how many hosts Taboot will run a
script against at a single time.

The ``output`` element allows you to mix and match exactly which
logging mechanisms to process the scripts output with.

The ``preflight`` and ``tasks`` elements define sequences of actions
to perform for each host. The ``preflight`` sequence is ran at maximum
concurrency before the main ``tasks`` body is executed. When
completed, script execution prompts for input before continuing.

These sequences are composed of items called `tasks`. Each task
represents an action or step to be repeated for each host. These
actions are things like restarting a service, deleting files,
installing packages, or disabling a member in a load balancing pool.

Some tasks, like ``service.Restart``, take arguments which are
represented as hashes or "key-value pairs" in YAML. Some tasks, like
``puppet.Run`` require no arguments at all. Other may have arguments
that are entirely optional.


.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Taboot Tasks stdlib <tasks>`


Updating Just One Host
``````````````````````

Lets start simple and do a yum update on one webserver,
``www01.ext.friendfrobber.com``. In the ``hosts`` element we specify a list
with just one item (our web server) and in our tasks element we use
the ``yum.Update`` task::


    # www01-yum-update.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www01.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      tasks:
        - yum.Update


That is the entire script. Run it like this::

    $ taboot www01-yum-update.yaml

When it runs you might notice a long delay before anything
happens. That will happen when a command takes along time to run, as
the output only updates once a task finishes.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`hosts` - Complete ``hosts`` documentation
   * :ref:`yum` - Complete ``yum`` task documentation


Output
++++++

You should see a screen similar to this when it finishes::

    Complete!


RPM Pre/Post Manifest
`````````````````````

Two more bundled tasks are the RPM ``PreManifest`` and
``PostManifest`` tasks. The ``PostManifest`` task is used (in
conjunction with the ``PreManifest`` task) to show you a summary of
the changes to your installed packages. This is especially useful for
verification in systems where an update should only upgrade/install
specific packages::

    # package-install.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www0*]
      tasks:
        - rpm.PreManifest

        - yum.Remove: {packages: [docbook-style-xsl]}
        - yum.Install: {packages: [puppet, python-netaddr]}

        - rpm.PostManifest

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`rpm` - Complete ``rpm`` task documentation
   * :ref:`examplepostmanifest`


Updating Multiple Hosts
```````````````````````

Taboot lets you target multiple hosts in a script. We can specify
additional hosts in a few ways. We could enumerate each host::

    # www-yum-update.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www01.ext.friendfrobber.com,www02.ext.friendfrobber.com,www11.ext.friendfrobber.com,www12.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      tasks:
        - yum.Update

    # Again, but demonstrating the alternative YAML syntax for list items
    ---
    - hosts:
        - www01.ext.friendfrobber.com
	- www02.ext.friendfrobber.com
	- www11.ext.friendfrobber.com
	- www12.ext.friendfrobber.com
      tasks:
        - yum.Update


Or we could use `globbing`, a technique where you give part of a name
and the rest is filled in automatically::

    # www-yum-update.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www*.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      tasks:
        - yum.Update

.. note::

    We could simplify our glob even further by using ``www*`` for our
    glob.


.. seealso::

    * `Func Glob Documentation <https://fedorahosted.org/func/wiki/CommandLineGlobbing>`_


Concurrency: Multiple Updates At Once
`````````````````````````````````````

Taboot lets you run scripts with different levels of
`concurrency`. Concurrency means doing multiple things at once. This
can save you time because it would mean we could run the
``yum.Update`` task on all of our web servers at the same time.

By default Taboot runs with ``concurrency`` set to ``1``. You have two
options available for setting the ``concurrency``.


Define It In Your Script
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Concurrency can be permanently set in your Taboot scripts via the
``concurrency`` element::

    # www-yum-update-concurrent.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www*.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      concurrency: 2
      tasks:
        - yum.Update



Via Command Line
++++++++++++++++

Additionally, concurrency may be specified or overridden via command
line with the ``-C`` parameter::

    $ taboot -C 2 www-yum-update.yaml


Conncurrencies "Gotcha"
+++++++++++++++++++++++

One "gotcha" when running with ``concurrency`` > 1 is that logs are
not guaranteed to maintain any logical ordering. This is because we
have multiple threads of execution happening in parallel. In this
situation there will be tasks entering and exiting at different times
based on when they originally started and how long they took to run.

The result is, for example, the log the messages for a script running
on ``www01`` becoming interleaved with the logs for a script running
on ``www02`` at the same time.



Additional Logging Techniques
`````````````````````````````

By default Taboot just prints progress on your console. This
``output`` type is called ``CLIOutput``. Some other types available
for formatting results are:

* ``LogOutput`` - Logs to a plain text file
* ``HTMLOutput`` - Creates a colored HTML file with anchors

You aren't limited to just one! Taboot can log to multiple logging
systems at the same time.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`output` - Complete ``output`` documentation


Logging To a Text File
++++++++++++++++++++++

Logging to a text file is another thing that can be controlled from
the command line at run-time. To add text file logging at run-time you
can use the :option:`-L` option. The default file name is formatted with a
timestamp (``taboot-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log``).

It's called in one of two ways:

#. By itself (uses default ``LOGFILE`` value) ::

    $ taboot -L www-frobnicate.yaml

#. With the ``LOGFILE`` option ::

    $ taboot -L megafrobber.log www-frobnicate.yaml


Logging to HTML
+++++++++++++++

``HTMLOutput`` is another available logging mechanism. Unlike the
``LogOutput`` type, ``HTMLOutput`` does not support any command line
options. However, it does have a system available for saving its
configuration in a configuration file.


``HTMLOutput`` is formatted using colors. Each task result is
formatted with an HTML anchor, allowing you to directly link to that
result.

Some tasks are ``HTMLOutput`` aware and will produce enhanced output
with extra styling. For example the ``rpm.PostManifest`` task will
color deletions in red and additions in green. ``puppet.Run`` will
colorize messages by severity. For instance, **err** messages are red,
**warning** messages are yellow, and **info** messages are in
green. ::

    # www-yum-update.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www*.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      output:
        - CLIOutput
	- HTMLOutput
      tasks:
        - yum.Update

.. important::

   Keep in mind that if you define the ``output`` element in your
   Taboot script then you must specify **every** logging mechanism you
   want to use. That includes defining the ``CLIOutput`` type!

Complete Example
----------------

.. note::

   This final section will combine everything described above into a
   realistic example suitable for the real world. It will also
   introduce the ``nagios`` task.

The ``preflight`` element allows you to execute a set of tasks against
all of the nodes concurrently. Before execution continues into the
main ``tasks`` body you are prompted to continue. This is especially
useful for giving you time to run or finish any preparation steps that
are required before you start running a script.

For example, a common infrastructure configuration would use Nagios
for host monitoring and ``Puppet`` + ``git`` for configuration
management.

A typical release, or *rolling upgrade*, has steps that include:
scheduling downtime for each affected service (on each host) in
Nagios. To prevent early-updates, before you commit your puppet
changes to git you would likely disable the puppet agent on all of the
target nodes. This might also be where you promote new RPMs into your
production yum mirror as well.

The ``preflight`` element was built to automate this exact
workflow. Lets see how that would look implemented as a Taboot script
using the hosts described earlier in this document. ::


    # www-rolling-update.yaml
    ---
    - hosts: [www*.ext.friendfrobber.com]
      output: [CLIOutput, HTMLOutput]
      preflight:
        - puppet.Disable
        - nagios.ScheduleDowntime:
            nagios_url: monitor.util.friendfrobber.com
            minutes: 10
            service: http

      tasks:
        - rpm.PreManifest

	- service.Stop: {service: httpd}

        # Puppet handles our system configuration,
	# so, no need for yum here.
	- puppet.Enable
	- puppet.Run

	- rpm.PostManifest


Lets highlight what's happening here

#. We're using a glob in the ``hosts`` element to target all of our
   web servers

#. Our ``preflight`` disables puppet and schedules 10 minutes of
   downtime for the ``http`` service on our Nagios server

#. After the preflight finishes all execution stops and we are
   prompted to continue::

    Pre-Flight complete, press enter to continue:

#. At this point we would commit, push all puppet code changes into
   git, promote our new RPMs, and then continue the release

#. A manifest of installed RPMs is taken on the target node

#. Apache HTTPD is stopped

#. We re-enable puppet and then force a manual catalog run

#. A manifest of the installed RPMs is taken and the diff is displayed
   against the manifest from the ``PreManifest`` so we can verify our
   intended changes landed


When it comes time to run this we decide to alter the described work
flow a little bit. We'll add the ``LogOutput`` type, so we have
something to send to our boss later. Because we're running late to the
Wednesday IT meetup at the local watering hole we elect to skip the
pre-flight too. (Ouch, no Nagios downtime? Our co-workers are going to
hate us for that later) We're also going to run this against
everything at once (who needs rolling-updates anyway?) ::

    $ taboot -sC 4 -L new-megafrobber-update.log www-rolling-update.yaml && \
        mail -s "Megafrobber release logs for `date`" \
	pointy-haired-boss@friendfrobber.com < www-rolling-update.yaml

More Command Line Features
--------------------------

The ``taboot`` command offers additional features not described above.

.. option:: -p, --printonly
.. option:: -n, --checkonly

   The :option:`-n` and :option:`-p` options are very similar. The
   former loads a script and does basic syntax validation. The latter
   also validates, as well as prints out the optimized YAML.

   The :option:`-n` and :option:`-p` options occur late in the parsing
   sequence. Therefore they both are able to validate the result of
   any edits made with :option:`-E` or with :option:`-L`.

   Taboots document validation catches basic script errors.

   Dispite it's best attempts, validation isn't accurate 100% of the
   time when describing illegal syntax. Note however, it will never
   throw a false positive either. t's 100% better than a stack
   trace in the middle of a release.


.. option:: -E, --edit

   :option:`-E` opens an editor and lets you make quick one-off edits
   to a script. Great if you need to make a temporary change without
   having to first make a copy of the source script.


.. option:: -L [LOGFILE], --logfile [LOGFILE]

   Adds ``LogOutput`` to the ``output`` element. The default file name
   is formatted with a timestamp
   (``taboot-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log``). You can specify an alternative
   log file name by specifying ``LOGFILE`` after giving the
   :option:`-L` flag.


.. option:: -s, --skippreflight

   The :option:`-s` option allows you to skip all ``preflight``
   elements.


.. option:: -C [CONCURRENCY], --concurrency [CONCURRENCY]

   Allows you to change the concurrency at run-time. Give the
   :option:`-C` option followed by the desired level of concurrency
   (as an integer).


.. seealso::

   * :ref:`man` - The :manpage:`taboot(1)` man page. For
     quick-reference there is also a :manpage:`taboot-tasks(5)` man
     page which describes the syntax and provides examples of each
     built-in task as well as the different ``output`` types.
