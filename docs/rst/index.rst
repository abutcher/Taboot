   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Documentation for Taboot!
=========================

Taboot lets you write a script of actions (:ref:`tasks`) and execute
it on multiple hosts, concurrently if you wish. The actions come from
a standard library, this ensures consistency. Taboot ships with
multiple forms of logging (:ref:`output`). A little Python is all you
need to know if you want to expand the library with your own custom
tasks.
